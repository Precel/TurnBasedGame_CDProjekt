# Turn Based Game in Unity3D
Simple turn based game made for recruitment process.

Demo is available here: https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/69335113/turnbased_web/turnbased/turnbased.html

Features:
- Hex based grid + navigation algorithms, path search, range calculator etc.
- Basic AI
- Camera Navigation (quite bad, needs to be fixed)
- Turn Based mechanics of course

Issues:
- UI is very blurry
- Camera movement is very bad
- Hit effects are miserable
- UI is not clear, units hp is not visible instantly
- AI can only move and attack, doesn't use bombs or rise attacks
